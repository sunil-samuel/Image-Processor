    <h2>Huggingface Token</h2>
    <p>A Huggingface token is required to run the AI models that are responsible for generating the descriptive text for
        images.</p>
    <p>Visit the following URL to generate the token: <a
            href="https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens">https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens</a></p>
    <p>Once the token is generated, use <code>File->Set Huggingface Token</code> and place this newly created token into
        the text box. This will persist the token into your personal folder so that the next time you run this
        application, the token is already set.</p>

    <h2>Processing Options</h2>
    <p>The 'Processing Options' are configuration paramters as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Add Created Date</b>: Inspect the image for the 'date taken' information using the EXIF meta data. If
            this date exist, then the file is prefixed with this date. If the 'date taken' does not exist, then the
            OS file creation date is used. </li>
        <li><b>Open Sub-Folders</b>: Traverse the 'Source Directory' and any sub folders within this directory.
            Otherwise, just load images from the 'Source Directory'.
        </li>
        <li><b>Move Files</b> or <b>Copy Files</b>: NOTE: Only either 'Move Files' or 'Copy Files' can be selected. If
            selected, then the images are moved or copied to the destination directory selected within the 'Destination
            Directory Selection' area. Year directories with the format YYYY will be created to store the files within
            the
            corresponding years.</li>
        <li><b>Create Month Folder</b>: NOTE: Only enabled is either 'Move Files' or 'Copy Files' is selected. Create
            month will create another sub-folder within the year folder for the month in the format MM-MonthName, e.g.
            01-January</li>
        <li><b>AI Description</b>: Use huggingface models to dynamically describe the the images. These descriptions are
            then stored within the EXIF metadata within the UserComment section.<br><br>
            The level of detail of the description that is created can be selected.<br>
            <b>Brief</b>: The caption is brief and short<br>
            <b>Standard</b>: The caption is more detailed<br>
            <b>Full</b>: The caption has lots of detail of the image
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2>Source Directory Selection</h2>
    <p>Select the directory path to where all of the images are stored. The application will traverse this directory and
        analyze each image.</p>

    <h2>Destination Directory Selection</h2>
    <p>If you selected 'Move Files' or 'Copy Files', then provide the directory where these images will be moved or
        copied. The files will be moved to a directory that corresponds with the 'date taken' year, with the format
        YYYY. If 'Create Month Folder' is selected, then there will be another sub-folder with the month.</p>
